## Brief History Of JavaScript
>In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brendan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally called Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.

>According to GitHubâ€™s 2021 Octoverse report, there are more JavaScript code repositories than any other language, and that number is steadily on the rise.

>JavaScript can be found virtually everywhere on the Internet. It has been named the most widely used programming language several times with over 64.9 percent of developers using it in 2021.

## JavaScript Versions

>In the beginning there was JavaScript and this was submitted to ECMA international as a standard. This new language standard was called ECMAScript. JavaScript is the most popular implementation of this standard. JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it. A new version of ECMAScript is released every year.

>1) Install the latest version of Node.js
>2) Open Visual studio code and create js file
>3) Run node hello.js
>4) See the result

### 3. By creating web pages 
>JavaScript was initially created to make web pages  interactive, that's why JavaScript and HTML go hand in  hand. To run JS from a webpage, follow these steps:

>1) Create new folder
>2) Create index.html, script.js files
>3) Write shown line of codes

## JavaScript Variables and Constants
>In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them. However, there are some differences between them.

>If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended
to use const.
